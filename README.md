I am a third-year Artificial Intelligence - Intelligent Systems student at the Technical University of Sofia and intern DevOps and I am ready to immerse myself in the world of the working environment and build new knowledge.
I consider myself a creative person who meets challenges with a smile. Working on complex and innovative projects excites me and I am ready to stand side by side with
a team of people to solve problems and develop technologies.
